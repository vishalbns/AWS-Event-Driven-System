## 🔷 **Step 1: Event Generation & Ingestion** 
### 🛜 **Mobile & IoT Devices → AWS EventBridge** 
- Events originate from **mobile/web apps** & **IoT devices**. 
- **EventBridge** serves as the entry point for all events. 
### **Why EventBridge?** 
- **Managed Event Bus** – Handles high throughput with low latency. 
  - **Structural Validation** – Ensures event format correctness before further processing. 
- #### **Flow:** 
1⃣Mobile & IoT devices send events to **EventBridge**. 

` `2⃣EventBridge applies **basic structural validation** (schema check).  3⃣✅ If valid → Forwarded to the **Lambda Verification Function**. 

` `4⃣❌ If invalid → Sent to **Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) for later review**. ![ref1]
## 🔷 **Step 2: Event Verification & Processing** 
### 🛡 **AWS Lambda (Verification Lambda) → AWS Lambda (Calculation Lambda)** 
Once an event passes structural validation, it undergoes **further verification** to check: 

- Business logic compliance 
- Required fields and data accuracy 
### **Why Lambda for Verification?** 
- **Serverless & Auto-scaling** – Processes events in parallel. 
  - **Low-cost execution** – Runs only when needed. 
- #### **Flow:** 
1⃣**Verification Lambda** checks event details. 

` `2⃣✅ If valid → Sent to **Calculation Lambda** for processing.  3⃣❌ If invalid → Sent to **DLQ for failure handling**. 
### 📊 **AWS Lambda (Calculation Lambda) → Amazon S3** 
Once verified, the event is **processed and stored**. 
### **Why Lambda for Calculation?** 
- **On-demand execution** – Auto-scales based on load. 
  - **Lightweight & efficient** – No need for dedicated servers. 
### **Why S3 for Storage?** 
- **Cost-effective** – Stores large volumes of event data. 
  - **Durability** – 99.999999999% (11 9’s) availability. 
- #### **Flow:** 
1⃣**Calculation Lambda** performs key business logic. 

` `2⃣✅ Successful results are stored in **S3 for long-term storage**.  3⃣❌ If processing fails → Event goes to **DLQ for later retries**. ![ref1]
## 🔷 **Step 3: Monitoring & Error Detection** 
### 🔍 **AWS CloudWatch (Error Monitoring & Flagging)** 
All **EventBridge, Lambda, and S3** activities are monitored by **CloudWatch**. 
### **Why CloudWatch?** 
- **Observability** – Monitors logs, metrics, and anomalies. 
  - **Automation** – Can trigger Lambda for corrections. 
- #### **Flow:** 
1⃣CloudWatch **monitors logs and metrics** from EventBridge, Lambda, and S3.  2⃣If errors/discrepancies are detected → **Triggers Correction Lambda**. 

` `3⃣**Correction Lambda** determines if recalculation is needed. ![ref1]
## 🔷 **Step 4: Anomaly Detection & Reprocessing** 
### 🤖 **Amazon SageMaker (Anomaly Detection)** 
- S3-stored event data is **retrieved by SageMaker**. 
- SageMaker’s **ML models** detect **anomalies or incorrect calculations**. 
- If an anomaly is found → **Sends a notification to CloudWatch**. 
### **Why SageMaker?** 
- **Scalable Machine Learning** – Learns from past incorrect events. 
  - **Automated Anomaly Detection** – No need for manual tracking. 
- #### **Flow:** 
1⃣SageMaker retrieves processed event data from **S3**. 

` `2⃣**ML Model detects anomalies** in calculations. 

` `3⃣If anomaly is found → SageMaker sends an **alert to CloudWatch**.  4⃣CloudWatch triggers **Correction Lambda** for reprocessing. ![ref1]
## 🔷 **Step 5: Automated Event Correction & Reprocessing** 
### 🛠 **AWS Lambda (Correction Lambda) → AWS Lambda (Recalculation Lambda)** 
Once an event is flagged, the **Correction Lambda** decides if recalculation is needed. 
- #### **Flow:** 
1⃣**Correction Lambda** checks DynamoDB for previous corrections. 

` `2⃣**If never corrected** → Sent to **Recalculation Lambda**. 

` `3⃣**If already corrected once** → Sent to **SQS DLQ** for manual review.  4⃣**Successful recalculations** → Overwrite event data in **S3**. 
### **Why DynamoDB?** 
- **Tracks correction history** → Prevents infinite loops of retrying. 
  - **Fast lookups** → Ensures correction is not repeated unnecessarily. 
## 🔷 **Step 6: Dead Letter Queue (Final Retries & Investigation) ![ref1]**
### ❌ **SQS DLQ (Final Retry Mechanism & Investigation Storage)** 
- Events that **fail multiple times** are stored in **DLQ**. 
- A **Lambda function periodically checks DLQ** and retries processing. 
### **Why DLQ?** 
- **Prevents Event Loss** – Stores all failed events for later analysis. 
  - **Retry Handling** – Lambda function can **retry events before archiving**. ![ref1]

🔷 **Step 7: Dead Letter Queue (Final Retries & Investigation)** ❌ **SQS DLQ (Final Retry Mechanism & Investigation Storage)**

All events that **fail validation, processing, or correction** multiple times are stored in **SQS Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)**. 

A **DLQ Processing Lambda** is triggered when events land in the DLQ to attempt a final retry. 

💡 **Why DLQ?** 

- **Prevents Event Loss** – Captures all failed events for analysis. 
- **Automatic Retries** – A Lambda function checks the DLQ and retries processing. 
- **Separation of Concerns** – Ensures failed events do not clog the main processing pipeline. 
- **Flow:** 

` `1⃣DLQ stores failed events for later review. 

` `2⃣A **Lambda function** is triggered when events are added to DLQ.  3⃣Lambda **checks DynamoDB** if the event was already corrected: 

- ✅ If **not corrected before** → Sent to **Recalculation Lambda**. 
- ❌ If **already corrected once** → Pushed to **S3 Failure Storage** for manual investigation. 

  ` `4⃣If recalculation is **successful**, the event is **overwritten in S3**. 

  ` `5⃣If **failure persists even after retries**, event is stored permanently in **S3 for manual intervention**.

🛠 **Enhanced Approach with Additional Tools** 🔧** 

If I had access to more tools like a **database** (e.g., Amazon RDS or DynamoDB) and **logs**, the approach would evolve to include **historical event storage** for faster recalculations and anomaly detection. By using a database, I could **retrieve past events** more efficiently instead of relying solely on S3, enabling quicker anomaly detection and comparison with historical data. Integrating **OpenSearch (Elasticsearch)** for **log analytics** would provide real-time insights, making error resolution faster and more proactive. Additionally, utilizing **Kinesis** for **real-time streaming** could enhance processing efficiency, enabling **immediate anomaly detection** without needing batch processing, further boosting scalability and responsiveness. 🚀📈 ![ref1]
