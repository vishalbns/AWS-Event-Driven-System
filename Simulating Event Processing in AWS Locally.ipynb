    "# Simulating Event Processing in AWS Locally\n",
    "\n",
    "**Introduction**: In this notebook, I simulate an event processing pipeline similar to what would be implemented using AWS services like EventBridge, Lambda, S3, CloudWatch, and Dead Letter Queue (DLQ). I simulate event generation, validation, processing, anomaly detection, and failure handling with retries. The goal is to mimic the core functionalities in a local environment for better understanding and testing of the entire event-driven architecture.\n"
